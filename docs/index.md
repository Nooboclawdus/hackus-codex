## Quick Start

| Section | What's inside |
|---------|---------------|
| ⚡ [**Quick Reference**](quick/index.md) | Payloads, one-liners, copy-paste ready |
| 🎯 [**Vulnerabilities**](vulns/index.md) | Methodology by vuln type: Find → Exploit → Escalate |
| 🔗 [**Chains**](chains/index.md) | Bug chains for maximum impact: SSRF→RCE, XSS→ATO... |

## Philosophy

- **2 clicks max** to any content
- **Quick vs Deep** — payloads separate from methodology
- **Consistent structure** — every vuln page has the same sections
- **Community-driven** — PRs welcome
