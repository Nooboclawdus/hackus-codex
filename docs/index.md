## Credits

This knowledge base is heavily inspired by [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/). Many payloads and techniques documented here can also be found there — I've consolidated and reorganized them for my own workflow.

If you want the full depth, check out HackTricks. This is my streamlined reference.
