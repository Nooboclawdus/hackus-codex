## One-Liners

### Recon

```bash

subfinder -d target.com -silent | httpx -silent

# Find parameters
echo "https://target.com" | gau | grep "=" | qsreplace "FUZZ"

# JS files
echo "https://target.com" | gau | grep -E "\.js$" | httpx -silent

# Find endpoints in JS
cat urls.txt | xargs -I{} curl -s {} | grep -oE "(\/[a-zA-Z0-9_\-\/]+)" | sort -u
```

### Quick Tests

```bash
# XSS reflection test
echo "https://target.com/search?q=xss123test" | httpx -match-string "xss123test"

# Open redirect
curl -I "https://target.com/redirect?url=https://evil.com" 2>/dev/null | grep -i location

# SSRF with collaborator
curl "https://target.com/fetch?url=http://YOUR-ID.oast.fun"
```

### Headers to Test

```bash
# Host header injection
curl -H "Host: evil.com" https://target.com
